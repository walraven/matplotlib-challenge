    "# Creating a scatter plot that shows how the tumor volume changes over time for each treatment.\n",
    "# Creating a scatter plot that shows how the number of metastatic (cancer spreading) sites changes over time for each treatment.\n",
    "# Creating a scatter plot that shows the number of mice still alive through the course of treatment (Survival Rate)\n",
    "# Creating a bar graph that compares the total % tumor volume change for each drug across the full 45 days.\n",

    "#considerations:\n",
    "# You must use proper labeling of your plots, including aspects like: Plot Titles, Axes Labels, Legend Labels, X and Y Axis Limits, etc.\n",
    "# Your scatter plots must include error bars\n",
    "# Your legends should not be overlaid on top of any data.\n",
    "# Your bar graph should indicate tumor growth as red and tumor reduction as green.\n",
    "# It should also include a label with the percentage change for each bar. "
